    <section title="Introduction" anchor="d1e329">
      <t>
Over the last few years there have been several major attacks on TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>, including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and modes of operation. Details are given in  <xref target="sec_Attacks"/>, but suffice it to say that both AES-CBC and RC4, which together make up for most current usage, have been seriously attacked in the context of TLS.</t>
      <t>
This situation was one of the motivations for the creation of the UTA working group,
which is tasked with the creation of generic and protocol-specific recommendations
for the use of TLS and DTLS.</t>
      <t>
"Attacks always get better; they never get worse" (ironically, this saying is attributed to the NSA). This list of attacks describes our knowledge as of this writing. It seems likely that new attacks will be invented in the future.</t>
      <t>
For a more detailed discussion of the attacks listed here, the interested reader is referred to <xref target="Attacks-iSec"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Attacks on TLS" anchor="sec_Attacks">
      <t>
This section lists the attacks that motivated the current recommendations. This is not intended to be an extensive survey of TLS's security.</t>
      <t>
While there are widely deployed mitigations for some of the attacks listed below, we believe that their root causes necessitate a more systemic solution.</t>
      <t>
      When such an identifier exists for an attack,
      we have included its CVE (Common Vulnerabilities
      and Exposures) ID. CVE <xref target="CVE"/> is an extensive,
      industry-wide database of software
      vulnerabilities.
      </t>
      <section title="SSL Stripping">
      <t>
      Various attacks attempt to remove the use of SSL/TLS altogether, by modifying unencrypted protocols that request the use of TLS,
      specifically modifying HTTP traffic and HTML pages as they pass on 
      the wire. These attacks are known collectively as SSL Stripping and were first introduced by Moxie Marlinspike
      <xref target="SSL-Stripping"/>. In the context of Web traffic, these attacks are only effective if the
	client initially accesses a Web server using HTTP. A commonly used mitigation is HTTP Strict
	Transport Security (HSTS) <xref target="RFC6797"/>.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="STARTTLS Command Injection Attack (CVE-2011-0411)">
      <t>
      Similarly, there are attacks on the transition between unprotected and TLS-protected traffic.
      A number of IETF application protocols have used an application-level command,
	usually STARTTLS, to upgrade a clear-text connection to use TLS. Multiple
	implementations of STARTTLS had a flaw where an application-layer input buffer
	retained commands that were pipelined with the STARTTLS command, such that
	commands received prior to TLS negotiation are executed after TLS negotiation.
	This problem is resolved by requiring the application-level command input
	buffer to be empty before negotiating TLS. Note that this flaw lives in the
	application layer code and does not impact the TLS protocol directly.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="BEAST (CVE-2011-3389)" anchor="d1e392">
        <t>
The BEAST attack <xref target="BEAST"/> uses issues with the TLS 1.0 implementation of CBC (that is, the predictable initialization vector) to decrypt parts of a packet, and specifically to decrypt HTTP cookies when HTTP is
run over TLS.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Lucky Thirteen (CVE-2013-0169)" anchor="d1e407">
        <t>
A consequence of the MAC-then-encrypt design in all current versions of TLS is the existence of padding oracle attacks <xref target="Padding-Oracle"/>. A recent incarnation of these attacks is the Lucky Thirteen attack <xref target="CBC-Attack"/>, a timing side-channel attack that allows the attacker to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.</t>
<t>
The Lucky Thirteen attack can be
   mitigated by using authenticated encryption like AES-GCM <xref target="RFC5288"/>
   or encrypt-then-mac <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-encrypt-then-mac"/> instead of the TLS default of
   MAC-then-encrypt.
</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Attacks on RC4" anchor="d1e428">
        <t>
The RC4 algorithm <xref target="RC4"/> has been used with TLS (and previously, SSL) for many years.
RC4 has long been
   known to have a variety of cryptographic weaknesses, e.g. <xref target="RC4-Attack-Pau"/>,
   <xref target="RC4-Attack-Man"/>, <xref target="RC4-Attack-FMS"/>.  Recent cryptanalysis results <xref target="RC4-Attack-AlF"/> exploit biases in
   the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted plaintexts.
   </t>
<t>
   These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically
   exploitable; currently they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30
   encryptions.  As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a
   sufficient level of security for TLS sessions. For further details, the reader is referred to <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4"/>.
</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Compression Attacks: CRIME, TIME and BREACH" anchor="d1e468">
        <t>
The CRIME attack <xref target="CRIME"/> (CVE-2012-4929) allows an active attacker to decrypt ciphertext (specifically, cookies) when TLS is used with TLS level compression.</t>
        <t>
The TIME attack <xref target="TIME"/> and the later BREACH attack <xref target="BREACH"/> (CVE-2013-3587,
though the number has not been officially allocated) both make similar use of HTTP-level compression to
decrypt secret data passed in the HTTP response. We note that compression of the HTTP message body is much
more prevalent than compression at the TLS level.</t>
        <t>
The former attack can be mitigated by disabling TLS compression. We are not aware of mitigations at the TLS protocol level to the latter attack, and so application-level mitigations are needed (see <xref target="BREACH"/>). For example, implementations of HTTP that use CSRF tokens will need to randomize them even when the recommendations of <xref target='I-D.ietf-uta-tls-bcp'/> are adopted.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Certificate Attacks">
      <t>
      There have been several practical attacks on TLS when used with RSA certificates (the most common use case).
      These include
      <xref target="Bleichenbacher98"/> and <xref target="Klima03"/>.
      While the Bleichenbacher attack has been mitigated in TLS 1.0, the
      Klima attack that relies on a version-check oracle is only mitigated by TLS 1.1.
      </t>
      <t>
      The use of RSA certificates often involves exploitable timing issues <xref target="Brumley03"/>
      (CVE-2003-0147),
      unless the implementation takes 
      care to explicitly eliminate them.
      </t>
      <t>
      A recent certificate fuzzing tool <xref target="Brubaker2014using"/> uncovered numerous
      vulnerabilities in different TLS libraries, related to certificate validation.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Diffie-Hellman Parameters">
      <t>
      TLS allows the definition of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
      and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman parameters in its respective
      key exchange modes. This results in an attack detailed in <xref target="Cross-Protocol"/>.
      In addition, clients that do not properly verify the received parameters
      are exposed to man in the middle 
      (MITM) attacks.
      Unfortunately the TLS protocol
      does not require this verification, see <xref target="RFC6989"/> for the IPsec analogy.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555)">
      <t>
      A major attack on the TLS renegotiation mechanism applies to all current versions
      of the protocol. The attack and the TLS extension that resolves it are
      described in <xref target="RFC5746"/>.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Triple Handshake (CVE-2014-1295)">
      <t>
      The triple handshake attack [[TRIPLE-HS, add the reference when published]]
      enables the attacker to cause two TLS
connections to share keying material. This leads to a multitude of attacks,
e.g. Man-in-the-Middle, breaking safe renegotiation and breaking channel
binding via TLS Exporter <xref target="RFC5705"/> or "tls-unique"
<xref target="RFC5929"/>.

      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Virtual Host Confusion">
      <t>
	A recent article <xref target="Delignat14"/> describes a security issue whereby SSLv3 fallback
	and improper handling of session caches on the server side can be abused
	by an attacker to establish a malicious connection to a virtual host
	other than originally intended and approved by the server. This attack
	is especially serious in performance critical environments where sharing
	of SSLv3 session caches is very common.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Denial of Service">
      <t>
      Server CPU power has progressed over the years so that TLS can now be turned on by default.
      However the risk of malicious clients and
	coordinated groups of clients ("botnets") mounting denial of service attacks is still very real.
	TLS adds another vector for computational
	attacks, since a client can easily (with little computational effort) force the server to expend relatively large computational
	work. It is known that such attacks have in fact been mounted.
      </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Implementation Issues">
      <t>
      Even when the protocol is fully specified, there are very common
      issues that often plague implementations. In particular, when integrating into
      higher-level protocols, TLS and its PKI-based authentication are sometimes the source
      of misunderstandings and implementation "shortcuts". An extensive survey 
      of these issues can be found in <xref target="Georgiev2012"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>Implementations may omit validation of the server certificate altogether.
      For example, this is true of the default implementation of HTTP client libraries
      in Python 2 (see e.g.  CVE-2013-2191).</t>
      <t>Implementations may not validate the server identity. This validation typically amounts
      to matching the protocol-level server name with the certificate's Subject
      Alternative Name field.
      Note: historically, although incorrect, this information is also
      often found in the Common Name part of the Distinguished Name
      instead.
      </t>
      <t>Implementations may be validating the certificate chain incorrectly
      or not at all, or using an incorrect or outdated trust anchor list.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Applicability to DTLS">
    <t>
    DTLS <xref target="RFC4347"/> <xref target="RFC6347"/> is an adaptation of TLS
    for UDP datagrams.
    </t>
    <t>
    With respect to the attacks described in the current document,
    DTLS 1.0 is equivalent to TLS
    1.1. The only exception is RC4 which is disallowed in DTLS. DTLS 1.2 is equivalent
    to TLS 1.2.
